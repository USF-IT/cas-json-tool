## Pre/Post-Processing example script
## Eric Pierce (epierce@usf.edu) 9/20/2013
##
## This script takes four parameters:
##   gitProcess ACTION REPO_PATH FILE
##
##  ACTION: either "pre" or "post"
##      - "pre" ensures the JSON file in SVN matches the one in use
##      - "post" checks the updated JSON file into SVN
##
##  REPO_PATH: full directory path to the local git repository
##
##  FILE: JSON file that is being checked in
